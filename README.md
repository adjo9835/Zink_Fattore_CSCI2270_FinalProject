# Zink_Fattore_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Team Memebers: Abiel Fattore and Brandon Zink

Our project will consist of a graph contatining a linked list or vector of stores within each city. You will be able to transfer goods between each city and store, and buy goods and store them in a warehouse in each city. Our hope is that we will also impliment a monetary system and randomized selling in order to turn it into a playable game where there are costs for transporting and buying goods and then some randomzied amount will be sold each week, but this will depend on time constaints.
