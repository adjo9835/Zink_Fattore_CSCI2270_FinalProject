How to Download the code

Our project consists of a graph containing a vector of stores within each city. The project allows the user to be able to transfer goods between each city and store, and buy goods a store them in a warehouse in each city. There is also a currency system implemented so that the project could become a playable game. There are costs for transporting and buying goods and then some randomized amount will be sold each week. To keep the game going, the user with have to keep from having a balance of $0.

How to Run
Basically, to run the program, the user must have already downloaded the program and run it on any C++ workplace.

Dependecies
This program requires no third pary progrmas to work. The only thing the user needs to have is a program to run C++ code, like Code Blocks, for example.

System Requirements 
There are no system requirements.

Open issues/bugs
The only big issue with our program is that it is difficult to lose. Staying above a balance of $0 is pretty easy. If the user wants to lose then they are going to have to try pretty hard.




Our project will consist of a graph contatining a linked list or vector of stores within each city. You will be able to transfer goods between each city and store, and buy goods and store them in a warehouse in each city. Our hope is that we will also impliment a monetary system and randomized selling in order to turn it into a playable game where there are costs for transporting and buying goods and then some randomzied amount will be sold each week, but this will depend on time constaints.
