Team Memebers: Abiel Fattore and Brandon Zink

How to Download the code:
Download the zip using "Download zip" in the topright corner. Unpack the file and op the file called FinalProject, this contains all the files needed to run the code. Just open the FinalProject.cbp and compile and run it.

Project Summary:
Our project consists of a graph containing a vector of stores within each city. The project allows the user to be able to transfer goods between each city and store, and buy goods a store them in a warehouse in each city. There is also a currency system implemented so that the project could become a playable game. There are costs for transporting and buying goods and then some randomized amount will be sold each week. To keep the game going, the user with have to keep from having a balance of $0. This could also be very easily transiioned into a goods tracking program for a grocery company by just editing out the money part. That was our original thought, but the addition of the money and "game" tend to make it a bit more fun.

How to Run:
Basically, to run the program, the user must have already downloaded the program and open the .cbp file, and compile and run.

Dependecies:
This program requires no third party progrmas to work. The only thing the user needs to have is a program to run C++ code along with a complier, like Code Blocks, for example.

System Requirements :
This works in the provided VM and some Windows machines. We've been unable to try this on a Mac, but inside of the VM it should work fine.

Open issues/bugs:
The only big issue with our program is that it is difficult to lose, or run out of money. Staying above a balance of $0 is pretty easy. If the user wants to lose then they are going to have to try pretty hard. We attmpted to balance the game but didn't have the time avalible to actually provide a challenge.
